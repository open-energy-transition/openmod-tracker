The Energy Policy Simulator (EPS) is a computer model developed by Energy Innovation LLC as part of its Energy Policy Solutions project, an effort which aims to inform policymakers and regulators about which climate and energy policies will reduce greenhouse gas emissions most effectively and at the lowest cost.
The EPS allows the user to control dozens of different policies that affect energy use and emissions in various sectors of the economy (such as a carbon tax, fuel economy standards for vehicles, reducing methane leakage from industry, and accelerated R&D advancement of various technologies). The model includes every major sector of the economy: transportation, electricity supply, buildings, industry, agriculture, and land use. The model reports outputs at annual intervals and provides numerous outputs, including:
->Emissions of 12 different pollutants (CO2, nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and eight others), as well as carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e; a measure of the global warming potential of various pollutants).
->Direct cash flow (cost or savings) impacts on consumers, industry (as a whole), government, and several specific industries
->Human deaths avoided thanks to reduced particulate pollution
The composition and output of the electricity sector (e.g. capacity and generation from coal, natural gas, wind, solar, etc.)
->Vehicle technology market shares and fleet composition (electric vehicles, etc.)
->Energy use by fuel type from various energy-using technologies (specific types of vehicles, building components, etc.)
->Breakdowns of how each policy within a policy package contributes to total abatement and the cost-effectiveness of each policy (e.g. wedge diagrams and cost curves)
The EPS is a system dynamics computer model created in a commercial program called Vensim. Vensim is a tool produced by Ventana Systems for the creation and simulation of system dynamics models. The Energy Policy Simulator has been designed to be used with the free Vensim Model Reader. Directions on how to obtain Vensim Model Reader and the Energy Policy Simulator can be found on the Download and Installation Instructions page.
The model is distributed with a complete set of input data representing the United States, but it has a modular structure that allows it to be adapted to different countries and regions by swapping the input data. The EPS reads in all of its input data from external text files, which are generated by accompanying Excel files. All of these files are included in the model distribution.

multimod,MultiMod,"The energy system and resource market model ""MultiMod"" is a large-scale representation of the supply and demand of fossil fuels and renewable energy sources. It captures endogenous substitution between fuels, infrastructure constraints and endogenous investment (e.g., pipeline capacity, power generation technologies), as well as market power by producers of fossil fuels in a unified framework. 
The mathematical framework of the MultiMod model is a dynamic Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE) derived from individual players' profit maximisation problems. The formulation is generic and flexible, so that the supply chain of any number of fossil and renewable fuels can be modelled. The framework includes seasonality and allows for a detailed infrastructure representation and a comprehensive transformation sector. Investment in infrastructure (transportation, seasonal storage, transformation) is determined endogenously in the model according to the respective player’s inter-temporal optimisation problem. Furthermore, substitution between different energy carriers on the final demand side is endogenous. Modelling co-production of fuels (e.g. crude oil and associated gas) is possible, as well as a flexible setup of transformation units (multiple inputs, multiple outputs). By formulating the model as an equilibrium problem derived from non-cooperative game theory, the model can incorporate Cournot market power by individual suppliers as well as distinct discount rates by various players concerning their investment.
The current framework is an open-loop perfect foresight model. A stochastic version of the model is under development at NTNU Trondheim. This will allow for consideration of uncertainty and distinct risk profiles for individual players along the supply chain, including investment by consumers in energy efficiency.
For the model description paper, a database representing the global energy system was compiled and used for scenario analysis (Huppmann & Egging, 2014). New datasets or variations on the initial data base are currently under development within specific research projects:
- Focus on US domestic conventional crude and shale oil infrastructure (lead: Johns Hopkins University)
- Focus on Chinese coal policies (lead: Tsinghua University)
- Focus on the global crude oil market and refinery investment (lead: DIW Berlin/TU Berlin)

The model is formulated and solved as a Mixed Complementarity Problem (MCP) and implemented in GAMS, using MS Access and MS Excel for data processing and output reports. The code package includes a number of auxiliary routines and algorithms that greatly facilitate the compilation of the data set as well as calibration of the model.a set as well as calibration of the model.",,openmod,

quasi___gensim,QuaSi - GenSim,"GenSim - for ""generic building simulation"" - is a building simulation software using the EnergyPlus® simulation engine to generate high-resolution heating and cooling demand profiles as well as electricity demand profiles for buildings with various types of use. ""Generic"" in this context refers to a ""generally valid"" building model. This means that the software is versatile enough to simulate any type of building in a very flexible and simplified way, enabling users to efficiently adapt the software for any building design.
GenSim was specifically devloped for the use during project pre-planning where detailed simulations of buildings are challenging due to typically constrained time budgets and limited availability of information. Traditional simulation tools require extensive input data, making the process time-consuming. GenSim addresses this by providing presets for multiple building typologies and a streamlined approach for quick, simple, yet accurate building simulations. This is particularly valuable in early planning stages when only rough data about the planned buildings is available. If more detailed information (wall structure, detailed geometry, specific use, ...) is available about the building to be examined, this can be used for more precise results.

More information is available in the documentation: https://quasi-software.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gensim_user_manual/adthedocs.io/en/latest/gensim_user_manual/",https://github.com/quasi-software/gensim,openmod,
quasi___resie,QuaSi - ReSiE,"ReSiE is a software tool that simulates energy supply concepts for buildings, focusing on renewable energy, sector coupling and individual operating strategies. It is part of the QuaSi project that includes additional tools and can be used for individual buildings up to district-level or cities. Unlike many other tools based on systems of equations, ReSiE uses rule-based algorithms, system dynamics and an agent-based approach. This approach enables detailed simulations without linearization, capturing energy flow and system state in each time step. The central mathematical model is based on energy balances and the order of the energy calculations that is determined during preprocessing. In addition, ReSiE is suitable to perform black-box optimizations for optimal component sizing.

quasi___sodele,QuaSi - SoDeLe,"SoDeLe (loosely translated as ""Solar simulation as easy as can be"") is an easy-to-use tool for calculating energy profiles of photovoltaic systems. It is based on the well-validated python-pvlib, but offers a user-friendly GUI based on Excel (also a CLI with JSON input). SoDeLe can simulate PV systems with parameters from real PV modules and inverters with different orientations. Alternatively, preset standard modules and a constant DC-AC efficiency can be selected. The database of parameters contains more than 35,000 PV modules from various manufacturers.
The simulation is based on a weather file, which can be either an EWP file (EnergyPlus Weather File) or a .dat file from the German Weather Service (DWD).
With SoDeLe, the energy yield of planned or existing photovoltaic systems can be determined quickly and easily in high temporal resolution without much expert knowledge. The results can be used for dynamic energy system simulations, storage sizing or dynamic cost and greenhouse gas calculations. In addition, different orientations and different PV modules and inverters can be analyzed or the energy yield of existing systems can be checked if real historical weather data is used as input.

The results of SoDeLe were verified for different module-inverter configurations, orientations and locations using comparative simulations with the commercial software PV*SOL and with the annual totals calculated by PVGIS.ith the annual totals calculated by PVGIS.",https://github.com/quasi-software/sodele/releases,openmod,

region4flex,Region4FLEX,"The open source model region4FLEX quantifies, to which extent regional load shifting potentials can fulfill the local flexibility demand of the German high voltage grid (110, 220, 380 kV), e.g. for mitigating curtailment of renewable energies. The model offers an underlying database, which contains load shifting potentials on the administrative district level for Germany. The load shifting potentials are calculated by taking into account the structural parameters of the respective regions, such as employment rates in different industry sectors or the composition of the residential building stock. The local flexibility demand data of the power grid are calculated using the open_eGO energy system model. In region4FLEX, a cost optimisation defines, which of the available load shifting potentials in a region can be used, to meet the local flexibility demand. The resulting operating data, e.g. numbers of load shifting events, are used for a subsequent economic-assessment of the flexibility options from the operator’s perspective.
Model is under development. After release it will be directly downloadable.
